`NetworkKit` is a Swift package designed to simplify networking operations in `SwiftUI`. It offers three flexible approaches for fetching, downloading, and uploading data or files using `Escaping Closures`, `Combine`, and `async-await` techniques, allowing you to choose the method that best suits your project requirements.
